//the main idea would be to have methods according every project. For example: in the 'email-listener' there should be only receiveEmail, the one that is going to create an email and then nofify with websocket to the UI
//check this for registering objects with nestjs: https://github.com/academind/nestjs-introduction/tree/02-mongodb/src/products
//This is another example from FaztWeb: https://github.com/FaztWeb/nestjs-products-api/tree/master/src/product
//Maybe is good idea not to use decorators for this
//@Injectable()
// export class EmailService(){
//     receiveEmail(){

//     }
// }
